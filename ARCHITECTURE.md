# Recommended Architecture for Flutter Stores

This document outlines three recommended architectures for using the `flutter_stores` package. Each architecture balances simplicity, scalability, and flexibility while showcasing the strengths of `flutter_stores`. These approaches cater to different project sizes and needs.

---

## **1. Minimal Architecture (Best for Small Projects)**
- **Focus**: Keep it simple with direct use of stores, and limit abstraction layers.
- **When to Use**: Small projects or prototypes where simplicity and speed are key.

### **Folder Structure**
```
lib/
├── main.dart
├── screens/
│   ├── home_screen.dart
│   ├── add_task_screen.dart
│   ├── add_category_screen.dart
│   ├── search_screen.dart
├── store/
│   └── todo_store.dart
└── todo_provider.dart
```

### **Key Points**
- **Store Logic**:
  - All state management logic is placed in the store (e.g., `TodoStore`).
- **Business Logic**:
  - Basic logic stays in the store; no service or repository layer.
- **View Access**:
  - Access the store directly via `TodoProvider.of(context)`.

### **Advantages**
- Simple and fast to implement.
- Easy to debug due to direct access to state.

### **Disadvantages**
- Not ideal for large projects (limited separation of concerns).

---

## **2. Modularized Architecture (Best for Medium Projects)**
- **Focus**: Separate business logic into services for better organization and maintainability.
- **When to Use**: Medium-sized projects with a moderate feature set.

### **Folder Structure**
```
lib/
├── main.dart
├── screens/
│   ├── home_screen.dart
│   ├── add_task_screen.dart
│   ├── add_category_screen.dart
│   ├── search_screen.dart
├── store/
│   └── todo_store.dart
├── services/
│   └── todo_service.dart
├── models/
│   └── task_model.dart
└── todo_provider.dart
```

### **Key Points**
- **Store Logic**:
  - Store focuses on managing state and persistence.
- **Business Logic**:
  - Moved to services (e.g., `TodoService`) for reusable and testable business rules.
- **Models**:
  - Use `TaskModel` or similar to ensure type safety and consistency.
- **View Access**:
  - Access the store via `TodoProvider.of(context)`.

### **Advantages**
- Clear separation of concerns.
- Reusable services simplify logic and testing.
- Type safety using models.

### **Disadvantages**
- Slightly more complexity compared to the minimal approach.

---

## **3. Feature-First Architecture (Best for Large Projects)**
- **Focus**: Organize code by features, allowing each feature to encapsulate its logic.
- **When to Use**: Large projects requiring scalability and feature isolation.

### **Folder Structure**
```
lib/
├── main.dart
├── features/
│   ├── todo/
│   │   ├── screens/
│   │   │   ├── home_screen.dart
│   │   │   ├── add_task_screen.dart
│   │   │   ├── add_category_screen.dart
│   │   │   ├── search_screen.dart
│   │   ├── store/
│   │   │   └── todo_store.dart
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   │   └── todo_service.dart
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   │   └── task_model.dart
│   │   └── todo_provider.dart
└── common/
    ├── widgets/
    ├── utils/
    └── themes/
```

### **Key Points**
- **Feature Isolation**:
  - Each feature has its own screens, stores, services, and models.
- **Shared Logic**:
  - Place reusable widgets, utilities, and themes in `common/`.
- **Scalability**:
  - Add new features by creating a new folder under `features/`.

### **Advantages**
- Highly scalable and organized.
- Easy to onboard developers due to clear structure.
- Promotes encapsulation and modularity.

### **Disadvantages**
- Slightly more upfront setup.
- Requires discipline to maintain feature boundaries.

## **Choosing the Best Architecture**
1. **Minimal Architecture**:
   - Great for small projects, simple apps, or quick prototypes.
2. **Modularized Architecture**:
   - Best for medium-sized apps requiring reusable business logic.
3. **Feature-First Architecture**:
   - Ideal for large, scalable apps with multiple independent features.

These architectures leverage the flexibility and simplicity of `flutter_stores`, ensuring maintainability and scalability without unnecessary boilerplate. Choose the architecture that best fits the size and scope of your project.
