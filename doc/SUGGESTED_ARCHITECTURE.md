# Suggested Architecture for **upper_flutter_stores**

This document outlines three recommended architectures for using the **upper_flutter_stores** package. Each architecture balances simplicity, scalability, and flexibility while showcasing the strengths of **upper_flutter_stores**. These approaches cater to different project sizes and needs while leveraging the Unified and Separated store features effectively.

---

## **1. Minimal Architecture (Best for Small Projects)**
- **Focus**: Keep it simple with direct use of stores, and limit abstraction layers.
- **When to Use**: Small projects or prototypes where simplicity and speed are key.

### **Folder Structure**
```plaintext
lib/
├── main.dart
├── screens/
│   ├── home_screen.dart
│   ├── add_task_screen.dart
│   ├── add_category_screen.dart
│   ├── search_screen.dart
├── store/
│   └── todo_store.dart
└── providers.dart
```

### **Key Points**
- **Unified Store Logic**:
  - All state management logic resides in the store (e.g., `TodoStore`).
- **Business Logic**:
  - Minimal separation, with business logic directly implemented in the store.
- **View Access**:
  - Access the store directly via `StoreProvider.of(context)` or `StoreConsumer`.

### **Advantages**
- Simple and fast to implement.
- Direct access to state makes debugging straightforward.

### **Disadvantages**
- Not ideal for large projects (limited separation of concerns).

---

## **2. Modularized Architecture (Best for Medium Projects)**
- **Focus**: Separate business logic into services for better organization and maintainability.
- **When to Use**: Medium-sized projects with a moderate feature set.

### **Folder Structure**
```plaintext
lib/
├── main.dart
├── screens/
│   ├── home_screen.dart
│   ├── add_task_screen.dart
│   ├── add_category_screen.dart
│   ├── search_screen.dart
├── store/
│   └── todo_store.dart
├── services/
│   └── todo_service.dart
├── models/
│   └── task_model.dart
└── providers.dart
```

### **Key Points**
- **Unified Store Logic**:
  - The store manages state and integrates persistence, undo/redo, and snapshots.
- **Business Logic**:
  - Services (e.g., `TodoService`) handle reusable business rules.
- **Models**:
  - Use models (e.g., `TaskModel`) for type safety and consistency.
- **View Access**:
  - Access the store via `StoreProvider.of(context)` or `StoreConsumer`.

### **Advantages**
- Clear separation of concerns.
- Services simplify business logic and enable easy testing.
- Reusable and maintainable architecture.

### **Disadvantages**
- Slightly more complexity compared to the minimal approach.

---

## **3. Feature-First Architecture (Best for Large Projects)**
- **Focus**: Organize code by features, encapsulating all logic for each feature.
- **When to Use**: Large projects requiring scalability and modularity.

### **Folder Structure**
```plaintext
lib/
├── main.dart
├── features/
│   ├── todo/
│   │   ├── screens/
│   │   │   ├── home_screen.dart
│   │   │   ├── add_task_screen.dart
│   │   │   ├── add_category_screen.dart
│   │   │   ├── search_screen.dart
│   │   ├── store/
│   │   │   └── todo_store.dart
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   │   └── todo_service.dart
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   │   └── task_model.dart
│   │   └── todo_provider.dart
└── common/
    ├── widgets/
    ├── utils/
    └── themes/
```

### **Key Points**
- **Feature Isolation**:
  - Each feature encapsulates its screens, store, services, and models.
- **Shared Logic**:
  - Reusable components like widgets and themes live in a `common/` folder.
- **Scalability**:
  - Add new features by creating new folders under `features/`.

### **Advantages**
- Highly scalable and modular.
- Feature isolation simplifies collaboration and onboarding.
- Encourages adherence to clean architecture principles.

### **Disadvantages**
- Requires discipline to maintain feature boundaries.
- Slightly higher initial setup effort.

---

## **4. Advanced Feature-First Architecture with Store Inheritance**
- **Focus**: Extend stores with advanced features like custom middleware, computed values, and async operations using inheritance.
- **When to Use**: Large-scale projects that require deep customization and high performance.

### **Folder Structure**

lib/
├── main.dart
├── features/
│   ├── todo/
│   │   ├── screens/
│   │   │   ├── home_screen.dart
│   │   │   ├── add_task_screen.dart
│   │   │   ├── add_category_screen.dart
│   │   │   ├── search_screen.dart
│   │   ├── store/
│   │   │   ├── todo_store.dart
│   │   │   └── custom_store.dart
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   │   └── todo_service.dart
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   │   └── task_model.dart
│   │   └── todo_provider.dart
└── common/
    ├── widgets/
    ├── utils/
    └── themes/
```

### **Key Points**
- **Custom Stores**:
  - Extend the base store (e.g., `BaseStore`, `UndoableStore`) for specific requirements.
- **Middleware and Snapshots**:
  - Leverage advanced features like middleware and snapshots to track state changes.
- **Service Layers**:
  - Complex business rules remain in dedicated services.

### **Advantages**
- Full flexibility with advanced store capabilities.
- Powerful debugging tools with snapshots and middleware.

### **Disadvantages**
- Requires advanced knowledge of the package and architecture.

## **Choosing the Best Architecture**
1. **Minimal Architecture**:
   - Great for small projects, simple apps, or quick prototypes.
2. **Modularized Architecture**:
   - Best for medium-sized apps requiring reusable business logic.
3. **Feature-First Architecture**:
   - Ideal for large, scalable apps with multiple independent features.
4. **Advanced Feature-First Architecture**:
   - Suitable for large projects requiring custom stores and advanced debugging tools.
